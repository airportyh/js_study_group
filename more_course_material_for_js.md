Course Materials for Javascript
===============================

This is a list of the best online course materials for learning Javascript. The criteria to be selected are

1. complete - covers all the important stuff
2. self-contained - no need to go hunt down tons of other links
3. really really good - we want the best of the best
4. free as in beer is preferred but not required

For Beginners
-------------

1. <http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript> - (12 interactive lessons) - I did some of the lessons (Intro, FizzBuzz, and some others). I like the interactivity a lot, and combo that with live TA help I think it will be very valuable. I have a couple of conserns though, 1) each course is written by a different author, so there doesn’t seems to be good cohesion; 2) some of the instructions can still be confusing for students, but live help will alleviate this. Another thing I am thinking is: will students have no clue what to do once they are outside of codecademy’s friendly sandboxed environment?
2. <http://thenewboston.org/list.php?cat=10> - (40 ~5min videos) - I like that each video is very focused and understandable. But, there aren’t any accompanying exercises.
3. <https://tutsplus.com/course/30-days-to-learn-jquery/> - (~25 ~10-30min videos, 3 quizzes) - Only on jQuery, but cover some fundamental concepts and best practices for JS in general. The later screencasts might be good for more experienced programmers. The snippets, zen coding and other editor tricks would be a little distracting for beginners, I think.
4. <http://www.teaching-materials.org/> - by Pamela Fox

More
------

1. <http://channel9.msdn.com/Series/Javascript-Fundamentals-Development-for-Absolute-Beginners> (21 ~10-30min videos) - has an audiance identity crisis - meanders too much at places because of that.

For Seasoned Programmers
------------------------

1. <http://jqueryair.com/> (5 ~12min videos + interactive exercises) - extremely well done presentations with visuals + animations that explain things very clearly
2. <http://www.virtuosimedia.com/dev/javascript/15-essential-javascript-video-tutorials> (10 ~30min videos) - the 10 Crockford videos as a series. The Crockford series is how I learned Javascript.
3. <http://learn.appendto.com/lessons> (~50 ~6min videos) - seems more complete than I thought. I’ll have to look through more of it. But, the bent is towards established programmers definitely. Includes jQuery.
4. <http://codeschool.com/> - has paid courses for Backbone and Node.js - would be nice if we can find free alternatives
5. [PPK on Events](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjvux4rbkUY) - 1 hour long video by PPK on events and their browser quirks.

Books
-----

If you prefer a book to video lectures

1. <http://eloquentjavascript.net/> (book) - like the fact that it has solid exercises. There’s an in-page JS executor, but I don’t personally like using it. 
2. <http://javascriptenlightenment.com/> (book)

More
-----

1. <http://jqfundamentals.com/book/> (book) - pace is uneven, nice and basic in some places, but lots of code w/o explanation in others - Toby
2. <https://github.com/rmurphey/js-assessment> - run locally and write code to make the tests pass (like Ruby Koans). Haven’t tried it out yet, but thought it might be worth checking out. I tried this out, don’t think it’s mature enough; UX needs some work - Toby
3. <http://bonsaiden.github.com/JavaScript-Garden/> (article) a great catalog of weird quirks of the language which will surprise people coming from other languages - not exactly a course, but a good catalogue to read through

Other
-----

1. <http://try.github.com/> - not Javascript, but very important for Javascript developers of today.
